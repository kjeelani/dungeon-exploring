            <h1>Dungeon Exploring</h1>
            <p>In this game, you are stuck in a dungeon and you need to get out as quickly as possible. Everytime you move forward, there will be three tunnels that take you in different directions. Some tunnels can lead to monsters or traps that can kill you. However, you have your trusty <strong>DungeonMap3000</strong> that can intelligently calculate the shortest path to escape. Its recommended route will be listed below.</strong></p>
